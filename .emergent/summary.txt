The user initially requested a clone of the Oscar app. After clarification that it was the Oscar Home Services app, a detailed plan was established. The project scope is a comprehensive home services platform with separate mobile applications for customers and professionals, built using an Expo (React Native) frontend and a FastAPI backend with MongoDB.

Development began with setting up the environment and dependencies. The backend was built first, including APIs for user authentication, service browsing, booking, payments (Stripe test mode), location tracking (Google Maps), and AI-powered recommendations (OpenAI). The backend was seeded with initial data and tested successfully.

Next, the frontend mobile apps for both customers and professionals were scaffolded using Expo Router's file-based routing. This involved creating layouts, contexts, and multiple screens.

Following the initial build, several iterative enhancements were requested and implemented:
1.  **Rebranding:** The app was renamed ExperTrait, a new logo was added, and the theme color was changed to dark orange.
2.  **UI/UX Polish:** The login/signup screens were improved with better labels and the official logo.
3.  **Onboarding:** An animated splash screen and introductory onboarding screens were added.
4.  **Test Data:** Test users (customer, professional, admin) were seeded into the database.
5.  **Web Presence:** A new React/Vite-based website was integrated and served via a new  service.
6.  **Mobile App Features:** Profile pages were built out, and the customer home screen was updated with a promotional banner and a revised bottom tab navigation.

The most recent task, which is currently in progress, is a major overhaul of the customer home screen to include multiple dynamic sections for categories, featured services, and recommendations. The foundational components for this overhaul have just been created.

<product_requirements>
The goal is to build ExperTrait, a full-stack, on-demand home services marketplace. The platform consists of two mobile apps (for Customers and Service Professionals) and a public-facing website.

**Core Features Implemented:**
*   **Dual Mobile Apps:** Separate Expo (React Native) applications for customers to book services and for professionals to manage jobs.
*   **Service Marketplace:** Customers can browse and book from over 150 services across various categories.
*   **User Authentication:** Secure registration and login for both customer and professional roles.
*   **Real-time Tracking:** Professionals' locations are tracked using the Google Maps API.
*   **Payment Integration:** In-app payments are handled via Stripe in test mode.
*   **AI-Powered Recommendations:** OpenAI GPT-4o is used to provide smart service suggestions.
*   **Booking & Profile Management:** Users can view booking history and manage their profiles.
*   **Onboarding:** The app features an animated splash screen and introductory screens for new users.
*   **Web Frontend:** A separate, SEO-optimized React/Vite website serves as the landing page.

The application has been rebranded with a custom name (ExperTrait), logo, and a dark orange color scheme. Test accounts for all user roles have been created for QA purposes.

- **Frontend (Mobile):** Expo, React Native, Expo Router (file-based routing), , .
- **Frontend (Web):** React, Vite, TailwindCSS.
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python), MongoDB (),  (hashing).
- **APIs & Integrations:** Stripe (Payments), Google Maps API (Geolocation), OpenAI (AI Features).
- **Architecture:** Monorepo with distinct services for mobile frontend (), web frontend (), and API ().
- **State Management:** React Context API (, ).
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The project is structured as a monorepo with separate directories for the backend, mobile frontend, and web frontend.



**Key Files:**

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** The core of the application. This FastAPI server handles all business logic, including user authentication, service management, bookings, payments with Stripe, and AI interactions with OpenAI.
    -   **Changes:** It was created to provide a full suite of CRUD APIs, seeded with initial data, and later updated to serve the static web frontend files.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** Configures the Expo mobile app, including its name, slug, version, icons, and splash screen.
    -   **Changes:** Updated multiple times to rebrand the app to ExperTrait, changing the name and paths for the logo, adaptive icon, and splash screen image.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** The root layout for the mobile app. It wraps the entire application in necessary providers (like ) and manages the initial navigation logic (e.g., showing the splash screen, then onboarding, then the main app).
    -   **Changes:** Modified to implement the animated splash screen and onboarding flow.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** The main home screen for the customer app. It's the primary interface for users to discover and access services.
    -   **Changes:** Recently modified to add a  component. It is the target of the current major UI overhaul.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** Defines the tab navigation for the customer app.
    -   **Changes:** Updated to a new 5-tab structure: Home, Discover, Custom Task, Bookings, and Profile.

-   ** & **
    -   **Importance:** These directories contain reusable UI components and state management contexts.
    -   **Changes:** Recently, five new files were created here (, , , , ) to support the new home screen design.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** Contains the source code and build output for the new React/Vite-based public website.
    -   **Changes:** This entire directory was added to integrate a user-provided website template, which was then configured to communicate with the FastAPI backend.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
- **Build Admin Dashboard:** An admin web interface was discussed but not implemented. It's needed for managing users, services, bookings, and platform analytics.
- **Dynamic Content Management:** Implement backend logic and admin UI to allow administrators to update the promotional banner and category icons dynamically, as mentioned in user requests.
</pending_tasks>

The immediate focus is a significant enhancement of the customer mobile app's home screen, as requested by the user in message 280. This is a multi-part UI/UX overhaul intended to create a more dynamic and engaging user experience.

The request involves adding several new sections below the existing search bar and promotional banner:
1.  **Category Icons:** A grid of all service categories, represented by unique, admin-changeable icons. Clicking an icon should lead to a list of services in that category.
2.  **Featured Category:** A section highlighting services from one category that changes each time the app is opened, with a horizontally scrollable list of services.
3.  **Custom Service Highlight:** A section promoting the custom task feature.
4.  **Service Recommendations:** A section suggesting best of services to combine in the user's cart.
5.  **Popular Combinations:** A section recommending popular service bundles.

Work on this has just begun. The previous AI engineer's last action (message 282) was to create the foundational files for these new features using a bulk write operation. The following files were created:
-   
-   
-   
-   
-   

The engineer was about to proceed with creating the necessary navigation screens (, ) and integrating the new components and  into the home screen.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Create the remaining screens (, ) and the  to enable adding services to a cart, then integrate all new components into the  screen to build the new layout.
